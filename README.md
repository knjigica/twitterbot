# twitterbot
a simple bot which tweets strings from a google sheet. you can find it here [@womeninscienc11](https://twitter.com/womeninscienc11)
the google sheet used contains a list of women scientists, scraped from Wikipedia & cleaned in R, with some final (cleaning) touches added in the google sheet itself.
the code was inspired by the Twitter bot project available here AlbertoMontalesi/InspiredWebDev-Tutorials and [this](http://thelearninghub.in/pick-random-members-team-apps-script/) random-student-picking project
