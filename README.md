# twitterbot
a simple bot written in google script which tweets strings from a google sheet. you can find it here [@womeninscienc11](https://twitter.com/womeninscienc11)

the google sheet used contains a list of women scientists, scraped from Wikipedia & cleaned in R, with some final (cleaning) touches added to the google sheet itself.

the code was inspired by the Twitter bot project created by [AlbertoMontalesi](https://github.com/AlbertoMontalesi/InspiredWebDev-Tutorials/blob/master/Google%20Script%20for%20twitter/google%20script.js) and [this](http://thelearninghub.in/pick-random-members-team-apps-script/) random-student-picking project
