# twitterbot
a simple bot written in google script which tweets random strings from a google sheet. you can find it here [@womeninscienc11](https://twitter.com/womeninscienc11)

the google sheet I'm using for the bot contains a list of women scientists, scraped from Wikipedia.

the code was inspired by the Twitter bot created by [AlbertoMontalesi](https://github.com/AlbertoMontalesi/InspiredWebDev-Tutorials/blob/master/Google%20Script%20for%20twitter/google%20script.js) and [this](http://thelearninghub.in/pick-random-members-team-apps-script/) random-student-picking project
